Installation 

to Create an application in react we need create-react-app package for that we need node js

Once nodejs is installed 

Opne CMD 

and execute command to install CRA (create-react-app)
npm install create-react-app 

After CRA is installed execute commdand to create app

npx create-react-app appname

Introduction to web

FrontEnd + Backend 

Instagram.com

Frontend developers 
Html + Css (Static)

user interferes we need javascript 

Other than js there is no language which can understand user events 

Javascript is the Queen of the frontend 

React is a javascript library which proovides u components to design an application 

6-7 years back i got a charger 
with no seperate usb 

usb was fixed inside adaptor 

charger = usb + Adaptor

Component is a resubale individual functional unit 

If it gets damaged do u have to pay whole cost of charger
No only for the component 

Component is individual small reusable it is easy to maintain 


React provides us component based architecture 

In terms of web applications component may be the smalles portion(reusable) u seperate

Offical Documenation 

React is used to create SPA  

which loads the ui into body on requirement 

Gmail 
makemytrip.com
primevideo 

concept is - application does not reload

When we click on something ui changes inside the body but it doesnt reloads 

Technically spa are the ones which have one Body tag 

others are just partial html files which should not have body

All Angular react and Vue js are used to  create frontend 

Audi and BMW 

Hyundai offers pickup 
tata motors offers saftey 5 NCAP

Web applucation architecture is MVC 

Model view Controller 

Model is database 
Controller is Api 

View is frontened User interface 

View UI -- React stays at view layer 

Node js -- 

Before 2009 
if u have a file ashu.js 
was only executable inside browsers only in html files via scripting 

in 2009 invented node 

now u can run js file with node 

node filename.js
node ashu.js

Node js is runtime env for executing js files 
NPM - node package manager 

used to bring js files from a centeralised place 
npmjs.com where all the developers have publiched their packages for thw world to use 

npm is a tool to manage packages 

so thats why we installed a package CRA from npmjs.com into our machine 

Murali asked what is npm package 

any folder which contains package.json can be a npm package 


Any js project must contain package.json
if contains all the info about the package or project 

version name author description 
scripts and most imp dependencies 

what a package is dependend on 

u simply run npm install it will go package json and install all dependencies mentioned into package json 

Global and another one local 

local means into ur specific folder 

E:/xyz/newfolder/ here

D: /  local package will not accessible because it is into E drive 

npx to use local package as global 

npm install cra 

Static folder means which can directly be accessed inside browsers 

all the resources css images videos icons can be kept inot public folder 

src -- this is our main thing our logic our code 
developers's brain Source code 
package.json is heart of the project 

all the info is stored in package json 

Node_modules all 3rd party js libraries installed into this

iphone 13 

a box comes -- component 
phone adaptor manual pin -- components

one component contains another components 

A box contains n component basically it is a container over them 

similary app.js is the root component it will contain all other components inside itself 

JSX - javascript xml 
javscript xtension

in a js file react offers us to write html 


its knowledge is js 
but now it is extedned to html 

in summary JSX is the html portion in a js file 

Rules 
1) in JSX all the tags must be closed 
<input></input>
2) style must be used into style={{height:"20px"}}

style="height:20px; width:40px"
style={{height:20px, width:40px}}

3) All components must start with Caps letter 
<button>

<Button> user defined html 

Should rule 

4) Optional class should be used as className
it will throw only warning

DOM - contains all structure/properties of you html page 

Virtual Dom -  lighter copy/represntation of actual Dom

when u were - trend was u did calculation on rough sheet and placed the final anwer on actual sheet 

when we work in reac we work in lighter copy that is Virtaul dom 

once data is final we update it to the real dom 

why we do that 

because virtual dom is easy to traverse / faster traversal 

so faster loading of changes 

diffing algo is the cycle which compares actual do with virtual dom

when the difference is found it updates the dom

Ecmascript

specifications 
rules to use js 

to declare a varibale we have keyword known as var 

Es6 

Es5 -- browsers still understand es5 
we convert es6 into es5 and it is known as transpilling 

by babel 

Es6 is transpilled into es5 and then executed in browsers 
Browsers partillay supportd es6


New features we have to cover is es 6 feature 

let var const 
import and export 
()=>{}

var variables were global if defing something in a block 
we were not able to restrict it 

now we can 

using let  we can introduce block level variables 

const variables cant be re assigned 

const trainer  = "Ashu"

trainer =  something not allowed 

re assignment cant be done 

functions 

function square(num){
    return num*num
}

Arrow function came into es 6 
which are used as shorter expression like 

let square = num=>num*num

Arrow ()=>{}

Note -- this operator is introduced 

import and export 

N number of export statemenents 

NOTE - ONLY ONE DEFAULT EXPORT CAN BE WRITTEN
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

function A(){

}

A function when returns a view is a component 
Component is whatever u see individual small resuable enitity

create a components folder

create a file named with the component example Home.js
create a function and return a view from that
export that function 
whereever u want to use it import and display it 

Render 

Home component where are u using it 
App.js 

if u direct want to insert it into index.html

we have a function reactDOM.render(COmponent,wheretorender)


Js is to be used in jsx or in html we use curly braces

component will receive the data as input 

Receiving the data as input is known as props 

Props is an object passed from parent component to child component 


Cakelist component is parent
Cake component is child 

Cakelist component can pass the inputs to child
This process is known as Passing the props 

How do we pass the props to component ?

<Componentname prop1="value1" propN={valueN} />

Once They have rendered something they cannot change it 

Once component is rendered it does not update -- functional Components 

2nd type of components Class Components
state is an object which represents data over a period of time


Updtae 

if screen needts to be updated it should be statefull

update feature is lacking it is stateless 

NOTE : NEVER USE (=) Equals to for updating the state 
// FOR UPDATIN THE STATE THE FUNCTION IS this.setState()

and state is an object 

this.setState() will accept an object 
example  -----   this.setState({
    salary:"We will not increase anything"
})

onEvent={method_name/function_name}

Example 
OnClick = {demo}
onClick-{demo()} would be incorrect


Signup 

Name email password 
signup

import {button} from "react

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Lists and Keys 
to always render the array is known as lists 


when u repeat the same thing multiple times 
u will have a track of that by a unique value that unique value is known as key


we display lists using map function 

button 
div 
Component

var users = []

users.map((each,index)=>{
    return <button key={index}>{each}</button>
})

1 lakh 
50000

1
50000
1 lakh iteration 

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

2019 Feb classes are no more required

functional component state is missing they cant be updated 
for that we used classes 

Now to provide those features to functiona; components we have react hooks 

React hooks are the functions
they provide statefull features to stateless component

useState()
useEffect()

functional component was missing state so it was not able the thing

lets provide state  to function 

var [property,propertyHandler] =  useState(initial value)

componentDidMount()

useEffect(()=>{

}, [])


on everyupdate of the component it is getting called 


on mounting of component -- 
on updating of component 

Routing is basically
opening component on some specified routes 

Routes are a mapping of a path with a component

{path:"/login" component:LoginComponent}

when u open your project HOme/App.js
 rather than we will place Router 

 On whatever element u want to navigate

 u wrap that element into Link tag

 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

 Route params and route query 

 github.com/username
 linkedin.com/in/usernam

 /detail/:cakeid this is parameterized route 

 :cakeid is the parameter


 Second way to pass data to routes is route query 

 if u have any /abc so the query can be sent to any route 

 /abc?query1=value1&queryN=valueN

They get the info from url , noe u make a http request 
bring the details and show it to the component 

// in react we can make http request via inbuilt functon of js 
fetch

// from this fetch there is a third larty package axios 

// npm install axios 


reaching out to a http server for response 

url + method + requestdetails 

https://apifromashu.herokuapp.com/api

axios({
    url:"",
    method:post/get/patch,put,delete,
    data:body 
})

axios({
    url:"",
    method:post,
    data:json 
})

in get request we can't send body

json which is returned is response.data 
from that response.data we have to look out for what is coming

Search functionality 

when u click on search button u have to put that text onto search url by using query 

in that search page u have to take that text from url 
u have to bring the array from api and show it to user


api is -- https://apifromashu.herokuapp.com/api/searchcakes?q=thattextenteredintobox
method:"get"

/login

{email,password}
